# CS5228_Final_Project - I Need a Place to Settle Down

The repository includes:

- Task 1 (House Price Prediction):  
1) Python Script for EDA & Preprocessing  
2) Linear Regression Model of Best Performance  
3) Multi-layer Preceptrons (MLP) Model of Best Performance  
4) Random Forest Regression Models of Best Performance with 1.0, 0.8, 0.6 feature sampling ratio respectively  
5) Linear Regression Cross-validation Code  
6) MLP model Hyper-parameter Tuning Code  
7) Random Forest Regression Model Hyper-parameter Tuning Code  
8) Original Dataset and Auxiliary Dataset  

- Task 3

## Getting Started
1. Run .ipynb files with suffix '_Best_Perform' in the directory ./Task1/model, price prediction .csv file on test data will be produced for Kaggle submission
2. Run .ipynb files with suffix '_Tuning' in the directory ./Task1/model, hyper-parameters tuning can be reproduced for respective models
